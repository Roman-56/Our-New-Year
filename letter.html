    <h2>My love 🖤</h2>

    <p>
      This is our second New Year together, roshaa 💚🫂
We made it this far, and I truly believe we’ll be celebrating all our New Years together🥺💗. We’ve fought a lot—yeah, even just now—but I hope every fight becomes a lesson for us to understand each other more, change more, and love more🫂. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve always loved you sincerely, and that’s why I’ve always been okay with adapting myself to accept who you are. I’ll continue to do that, no matter what🫂🤞🏻. I’m always okay with taking the initiative to talk first when we fight—until I get tired—but I really want you to take the initiative too, even when I’m the one who stopped talking.😖🤌
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you every single day, to the moon and back 😚🫂💗💚🖤
I’m really, really sorry if I keep hurting you with my words or actions🫠🙇🏻‍♀️. I never mean to hurt you. Sometimes I just can’t control myself, but I do try, and I promise I’ll always be careful with my words🛐. As I’ve already told you, I’m not someone who argues for no reason—I only do when I get triggered. I request you to try and understand what irritates me and what causes it.📝
    <p>
      I wish we understand each other better and adapt to each other, because it’s only with us that we can truly be ourselves in a way we can’t be with anyone else.🤌 Let’s always be happy together, love each other, and be loved by each other—no matter what, to any extent🫂💗.

    <p>
      Thank you for loving me, understanding me, and choosing me — every single day🥺🫂. I lovee youuu soooooo muchhh babyyyy😚💗🫂💚🖤
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s to us, to our memories, and to many many New Years still waiting for us 🫂💗
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center; margin-top:30px;">
      Always yours 💚🖤
